Welcome to the Ashesi University Institutional Review Board (IRB) website.
On this website you will find everything you need to submit a human subjects
research study for ethical review.
To help protect volunteers, investigators must complete training and receive project approval from a
university Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning their work.
<li>
    The IRBs, comprised of faculty peers and community members, can approve, modify or reject proposed research based
    on its perceived risks and benefits to prospective subjects.
  </li>
  <li>
    The IRBs also look at quality assessment/quality improvement (QA/QI). The QA/QI administrator collaborates with
     investigators, research volunteers and administrators on behalf of the university in its efforts to meet regulatory
     requirements and maintain the highest ethical standards.
