  <b>ASHESI UNIVERSITY</b><p>
  <b>University Policy on Human Subjects Research</b><p>
  All research, involving human subjects, which is to be conducted by faculty or students from Ashesi University College must be approved by the Human Subjects Review Committee. This committee is the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Ashesi University. The purpose of this review is to ensure that the research activity is conducted with the safety of the human subject as its highest priority. The criteria for this review are in strict accord with international standards for the protection of human participants in academic research. All research to be conducted by students, faculty, staff, or research affiliates from other institutions must be approved prior to primary data collection or project initiation.
  Human Subjects approval must precede submission of all research applications to any sponsor for funding of the research effort. This applies to funding requests for internal or external resources, domestic and international applications. This policy applies to all applications including those to for-profit, not-for-profit, governmental or charitable organizations.
  The committee will respond to each proposal within four weeks following its review. If the Committee determines that a submission involves vulnerable populations or greater than minimal risk, the applicant will have an opportunity meet with the Committee to address issues of concern. The applicant will have an opportunity to modify the research design, sampling strategies, process or format of data collection, or any other concern that is raised by the Committee. Appeals can be formally addressed by the Provost with the Chair of the Human Subjects Review Committee. If an appeal is approved, the full committee will revisit the proposal and will entertain all concerns of the Principal Investigator. In the event that an appeal is also denied, the proposal must be closed for further consideration unless methodological and ethical issues are adequately addressed in the form of a new submission.
  All submissions must be in digital form. The submission must be approved with signature from the Committee Chair. Submissions are accepted on an ongoing basis.
  All submissions must be made using the Ashesi University Human Subjects Review Form. The form is found on the following pages and is also available at: website. Applications that are incomplete will not be forwarded to the Committee for review. Incomplete applications will be returned to the applicant. Applicants are advised to be mindful of schedules and time requirements for the review process and urged to submit proposals as early as possible.<p>

  <b>Exempt Activities</b><p>
  Investigators may not determine their own research to be exempt from HSRC review. Exemption decisions are made through the expedited review process.<p>
  Activities that are not research are exempt from HSRC review. Research is defined as: “A systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.”
  <p>Research that does not involve human subjects is also exempt from HSRC review. A human subject is defined as “a living individual about whom an investigator conducting research obtains (1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or (2) identifiable private information.”
  <p>Research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the following categories may be determined to be exempt from Ashesi University HSRC review. Requests for exemption must cite the statutory basis for the requested exemption from the categories listed below:
  I. Research<p>
  A. Research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, involving normal education practices.
  <p>B. Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), if information taken from these sources is recorded in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, directly or indirectly, through identifiers linked to the subjects.
  <p>C. Research involving observation of public behavior or survey or interview procedures for all of the conditions below. This exemption does not apply for research involving children except when the investigator does not participate in activities being observed.
  <p>(1) The research does not place subjects at the risk of civil or criminal liability or damage the subject's financial standing or employability, AND
  <p>(2) The research does not deal with sensitive aspects of the subject's own behavior, such as illegal conduct, drug use, sexual behavior or use of alcohol, AND
  <p>(3) The research does not use materials, procedures or settings likely to be embarrassing, upsetting or intrusive to the subjects, AND
  <p>(4) The subject cannot be identified and confidentiality is protected
  <p>D. All research involving survey or interview procedures is exempt, without exception, when the subject is an elected or appointed official or a candidate for public office.
  13
  <p>E. Research involving the collection or study of existing data, documents, records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if these sources are publicly available or if the information is recorded in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified directly or indirectly through identifiers linked to the subject.
  <p>II. Program Review
  <p>A. Government Regulations Exemptions. Research and demonstration projects that are conducted by or subject to the approval of Ghana government department or agency heads, and that are designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine 1) public benefit or service programs; 2) procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs; 3) possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures; or 4) possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs.
  <p>B. Ashesi Academic Program Review Data. Data collected for the purpose of the evaluation, review, and improvement of Ashesi University academic and extra-curricular programs is exempt from review unless these data are collected: 1) for use beyond program review (e.g. publication), and/or 2) for publication beyond the review process for Ashesi programs administered by Ashesi, by its associated accrediting agencies, and by other related educational bodies. Program Review research proposals that meet the criteria for exemption from review do not need to be sent to the Ashesi HSRC, however, it is advisable to do so as a courtesy and also to provide pre-project approval in case that decisions about external dissemination or publication change during the course of the project.
  <p>Note: The above exemptions do not apply to research involving venerable groups like prisoners or mentally-ill, institutionalized patients as subjects.
